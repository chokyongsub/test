    <h2>JavaScript란 무엇인가?</h2>
    <p>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[6] often abbreviated as JS,
    is a high-level, interpreted programming language. It is a language which is also
    characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm. Alongside HTML
    and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web.[7]
    JavaScript enables interactive web pages and thus is an essential part of web applications.
    The vast majority of websites use it,[8] and all major web browsers have a dedicated
    JavaScript engine to execute it.</p>
